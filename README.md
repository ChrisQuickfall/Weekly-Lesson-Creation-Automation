# Weekly-Lesson-Creation-Automation
This project allows a teacher to generate a set of lesson templates for their week with file names that aid organisation. It also archives lessons from previous days.


What will you need?
 - An installation of R
 - An xlsx timetable with four columns: week, day, period, and lesson. Each row of the timetable should correspond to one lesson. 
 - A pptx lesson template.
 - A file structure where archived lessons can be placed.
Examples of a timetable file, lesson template, and file structure are all included in the repository.
