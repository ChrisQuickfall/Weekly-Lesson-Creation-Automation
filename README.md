# Weekly-Lesson-Creation-Automation
This project allows a teacher to generate a set of lesson templates for their week with file names that aid organisation. It also automatically archives lessons from previous days in a sensible file structure.


What will you need?
 - An installation of R
 - An xlsx timetable with four columns: week, day, period, and lesson. Each row of the timetable should correspond to one lesson. 
 - A pptx lesson template.
Examples of a timetable file and lesson template are included in the repository.


Instructions
 - Download the lesson slide template and timetable.
 - Edit these or replace them with identically titled files,
 - Place them into an empty folder.
 - Open the R file and follow the instructions for each input.
 - Run the file, et voila! You should have your next week's powerpoints lined up and ready to populate with lessons.
